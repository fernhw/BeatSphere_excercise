# What is this?
This script contains a mesh reader, now you can turn any mesh into this insanity.

A dynamic sphere with similar properties.

And a procedural sphere, which is still useful just not as impressive.

You can import any 3D Model under 65000 vertices into this script.
Drag a mesh from an FBX and have it dance to the beat of the playing music.

# Story
Decided to give Unity's Mesh creating a go, have to create some particle, and prototyping systems for a game I'm making, also because I have experience with 3D engines, and graphic languages and it's about time I use those arithmetic skills in unity. This is a little exercise, it has a procedural sphere (A sphere you choose it's resolution via the generator), an FBX object that animates under the playing sound, and a Sphere that does so the same as seen in this tweet https://twitter.com/Fern_hw/status/980236180766720001

This software comes with no music in it. you have to provide the music to make use of the beat sphere, and Beat Mesh.
